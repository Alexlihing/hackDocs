## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was behind the fact that many people – especially women, face a lot of health problems and are unaware of what resources they have. HackDocs provides all the necessary resources for people to overcome their health issues, or find access to a medical professional for advice.

## What it does
HackDocs contains 3 features - 1) An AI Health Chatbot, in which you can ask the ChatBot questions and receive personalized answers about health issues 2) Medicine Tracker – The medicine tracker lets you put in the medicine you take and automatically uses public information to track information regarding the medicine. This tracker enables doctors with an easy access to a patient's medical information. 3) Doctor Finder. Given your medical problem and zip code you enter, you can find a doctor that suits your needs in the area.

## How we built it
Frontend: The Frontend was built with React and HTML/CSS.
Backend: The Backend was built with Express.js and Node.js frameworks, as well as various APIs, including the FDA Drug API, OpenAI API, and Google Places API.
Database: We used MongoDB as our database, providing a NoSQL database that allows us to scale this platform and make more changes in the future. 

## Challenges we ran into
As our team had 3 MacBook and 1 windows users, we ran into compatibility issues with node module versions. Despite 2 hours of debugging, we were unable to find a solution and resorted to using other modules instead that were compatible across windows and macOS. We also ran into issues using the Material UI framework.

## What's next for HackDocs
Next, we hope to publicly deploy HackDocs and scale it, as the platform provides a free and accessible way to get medical help, whether through a chatbot or by linking the user to a medical professional. We also plan to integrate a system that allows any of a patient's doctors to leave their medical report for other doctors to see.
